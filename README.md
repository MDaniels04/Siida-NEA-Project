<h1>Siida-NEA-Project</h1>
<h3>My school NEA project, a "simulation" of a Sami colony - a Siida - on an island.</h3>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
This is a project done for the AQA Computer Science A Level None Examined Assesment (NEA). 


While the simulation as it is may not do much impressive, I believe the systems implemented give the ability to modularly and easily add more "actions" for the AI to perform.
I may add more of these if I have time after exams, but I am very limited on time, as is the reason why the actions are so sparse.
