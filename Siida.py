    MESSAGES ABOUT THE CODE

    Please ensure you have read the Readme.md file in this repository before continuing. Cheers - Morgz <3
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This code is the code for my AQA A Level computer science NEA project.

    While the simulation as it is may not do much impressive, I believe the systems implemented give the ability to modularly and easily add more "actions" for the AI to perform.
    I may add more of these if I have time after exams, but this depends on other projects throughout the summer.
